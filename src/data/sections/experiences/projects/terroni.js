  description:
    'We redesigned and developed a new web experience for longtime favourite Toronto and Los Angeles Italian restaurant, [Terroni](http://www.terroni.com/). With a mission to offer a clean, easy, and family-friendly experience, our team devised the digital strategy, and built the entire online presence for Terroni’s family of restaurants. We took the original design and aesthetic of the brand and translated it to a visually pleasing online and digital experience filled with crisp, colourful, and delicious-looking photos.  The digital experience improves the customer journey while telling the story of the beloved brand while combining all business facets into one seamless experience.',
