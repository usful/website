  description:
    'We were there to make sure [Osheaga](https://www.osheaga.com/en) goers were well aware that the UK’s beloved TopShop was coming to Canada with a “TopShop Urban Oasis” tech installation at the popular Montreal music festival. Offering a place of calm from the festivities, here, guests could rehydrate with water and document their festival experience with branded cameras.  TopShop fans could also deepen their connection with the brand by joining in an interactive experience.',
  impact:
    'Not only did TopShop offer an unexpected and well-received experience to the 50,000 festival goers, the tech installation resulted in over 10,000 sign-ups.\n',
