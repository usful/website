  description:
    'To highlight the benefits of wellness in the workplace, we turned a section of downtown Toronto into a high-energy outdoor spin studio. Held in collaboration with a corporate health and wellness program, the outdoor spin cycling event offered two classes per day for two days. It involved a virtual reality (VR) component that allowed participants to experience a virtual cycle race before debriefing over local and healthy refreshments.',
  impact:
    'The impossible-to-miss installation got both the participants and passersby engaged and motivated, with business wear-clad audience members cheering on the participants in between meetings. The use of VR offered a multi-faceted and memorable experience. The first live session resulted in over 4,000 impressions.\n',
