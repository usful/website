  description:
    'With a mission to eliminate the red tape when it comes to bringing the best and most difficult-to-find wine to your doorstep, Usful helped create [VINI](http://www.vini.co).  With a goal of disrupting the traditional wine industry, the Usful team was responsible for everything from the market research, to product design, to product development.  The result was a full featured SaaS e-commerce platform for merchants to offer hard to find wines, and a web and mobile app for wine aficionados to get them delivered.',
  impact:
    '[VINI](http://www.vini.co) raised $500,000 in seed funding in-part based on the prototype Usful created with them.',
