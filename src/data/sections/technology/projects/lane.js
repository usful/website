  description:
    'Commercial Real Estate is one of the biggest asset classes in the world, but one thatâ€™s had little disruption. Noticing a growing need for active tenant engagement in the industry, and a clear void of technology solutions, we created [Lane](https://www.joinlane.com), the first fully featured tenant engagement solution for CRE. Lane brings modern SaaS & Mobile technology to an industry ready for disruption, becoming the central operating system for office buildings and connecting tenants with services and amenities.',
  impact:
    'Since the nationwide launch in 2016, the [Lane](https://www.joinlane.com) platform engages 60,000 tenants daily, and is used by companies with portfolios of over 200MM SqFt. Thanks to training and support from the [Lane](https://www.joinlane.com) team, property management companies now have an efficient and modern way to communicate with their tenants, increase engagement, and reduce tenant turnover.',
