  description:
    'With cash becoming increasingly a thing of the past, the way we give to charities is changing. Millennials typically find it difficult to donate because it isn’t as easy as a few taps. Created end-to-end by Usful, the Change for a Dollar mobile and web platform infuses innovation into the concept of charitable giving; it rounds up every purchase made to the nearest dollar and donates the change to the user’s choice of charity.',

    'Having won a placement at a product innovation event, and secured $5,000,000 in donated hours Change for a Dollar is currently raising a seed round for investment.',
